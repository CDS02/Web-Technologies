    <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
    <ul>
<li>
    <h1>Season 1</h1>
    
        <p id="pi">Before Breaking Bad became an absolute smash hit for AMC, it was pitched to HBO. Uninterested with the show, HBO rejected it. The channel didn’t see the future potential 
            of Breaking Bad. So, you can bet executives get riled up every time they see it mentioned, which is a lot.</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h1>Season 2</h1>
    <p id="pi">
        In a podcast interview, Vince Gilligan shed some light on some original ideas for the show that never got okayed. That list contained a pitch that included Jesse Pinkman being killed off in season two. Of course, the execs hated it so it never made it into the script.
        </p>
</li>

<li>
    <h1>Season 3</h1>
    <p id="pi">
        For most of Breaking Bad, there was a large distance between Walt’s criminal life and family life. In fact, the two never really collide until the fifth season. By then, viewers had a ton of knowledge on both sides of Walt’s double life.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <h1>Season 4</h1>
    <p id="pi">
        After a drunken night at a local bar with the crew, Cranston decided to get a small tattoo of the Breaking Bad logo on his finger, much to his wife’s disgust. It makes sense though, as this was without a doubt Cranston’s best performance of his career.
    </p>
</li>
     
<li>
    <h1>Season 5</h1>
    <p id="pi">
        While nobody has gone to the level of Bryan Cranston’s character in the show, a couple of struggling educators have actually been arrested for doing things similar to Walter While.

<h1>The Cartel</h1>
<img src="../images/g1.jpg">
<pre>History</pre>
<p>
    Initially, the cartel only served as the middle-men for the Colombians, transporting cocaine over the US border and receiving only a small part of the profit. This was mainly because they could not produce cocaine in Mexico, leaving them dependent on the Colombians ("Hermanos"). The cartel was feared by many, and it was said that even the Mexican Federales wouldn't mess with them. The cartel even had government connections, with Bolsa's brother serving as a high ranking police chief. At some point, Hector served 17 years in San Quentin prison ("Bit by a Dead Bee").


    Don Hector, Bolsa, and Eladio (1989)
    
    In 1989, Gustavo Fring and his romantic partner Max Arciniega, using their restaurant Los Pollos Hermanos as a cover to cook meth, gave samples of their product to several of the cartels foot soldiers, hoping this would grant them an audience with Eladio. Their plan proved successful, and they were eventually granted a meeting with the heads of the cartel (Don Eladio, Don Juan, and Don Hector). Gustavo proposed that the they start producing meth, effectively cutting out the Colombians and keeping all the profits for the cartel itself. However, Eladio considered meth to be "a poor mans cocaine", something that was only used by hillbillies and bikers. Despite Gus' attempts to persuade him, Eladio was already offended by the "underhanded" way Gus had gotten the cartels attention. He ordered Hector to shoot Max in the head while he was pleading for forgiveness. This enraged Gus, who tried to attack Hector, but was held down by Bolsa, forcing him to look at the dead body of his former partner. Eladio revealed that the only reason Gus had been allowed to live was because of his past connections, but warned him that he was "no longer in Chile" ("Hermanos").

    <br>Season 1<br>
    In 2008, Tuco was released from prison and began operating a successful drug ring and taking the remnants of his uncle's drug distribution business and employees a number of operatives and establishes his own headquarters for the cartel.
    
    His operation is extremely successful and he becomes a key man for the Cartel's operations north of the border and gradually he becomes one of the most powerful and influential dealers in Albuquerque. This helps the Cartel more in the North.
    
    <br>Season 2<br>
    A former cartel associate, "Tortuga", starts ratting on the cartel to the DEA and Mexican law enforcement. ("Negro y Azul") It is revealed in Season 3 that Juan Bolsa and the Salamanca Twins lured him into a bar and decapitated him. ("I.F.T.") His head is placed onto a pet tortoise and rigged with a bomb, then placed in a location originally intended to be a confidential meet spot. Law enforcement triggers the bomb, killing one Federale and injuring several DEA agents. ("Negro y Azul")
    
   <br> Season 3<br>
    There are already rumors swirling all over Mexico about a Heisenberg who has started encroaching on Cartel territory north of the border, with Mexican consumers acquiring a taste for the Blue Sky meth. In order to avenge the death of Tuco the Cartel sends The Cousins north of the border. The Cousins visit Hector at his nursing home and he reveals that Heisenberg's identity is Walter White. The Cousins are about to easily make their way to the White Residence, when Mike Ehrmantraut who has also been tailing Walt for some time, informs Gus of the impending assassination. Gus quickly reaches out to the Cousins, where he convenes a meeting and informs the Cousins of Hank Schrader, the DEA agent who was directly responsible for Tuco's death. Gus acknowledges that a hit on the DEA north of the border is outside the usual cartel M.O., but seeing as the Cousins feel the need to revenge on someone, decide to take up the offer anyways.
    
    <br>Season 4<br>
    Gus Fring, Mike Ehrmantraut, and Jesse Pinkman travel to Mexico to meet with the cartel. They arrive at the cartel lab, and Jesse bluffs his way through his inability to synthesize phenylacetic acid (back in Gus's superlab, it comes in barrels with a bee), demands that the lab be scrubbed spotless, and then watches as a digital readout inches above 96 percent purity for his meth. The cartel is very pleased, with Gaff (a cartel sniper who also hijacked a Los Pollos Hermanos truck) saying "First of many!" - Jesse's first indication that the deal Gus made requires him to stay in Mexico.
    
    
    All cartel leaders are poisoned as part of Gus's plot ("Salud")
    
    Almost immediately, however, Mike relieves Jesse’s mind (and cements his loyalty) by saying “I promise you this—either we’re all going home or none of us are.” Gus’ plan is to poison the entire cartel household with some rare tequila (Zafiro Añejo) he offers to cartel kingpin Don Eladio as a gift; he even takes the first drink (after swallowing a couple of emetic pills earlier). When the party is in full swing, Gus excuses himself to go to the bathroom (with one of Eladio’s henchmen standing guard), where he throws up the poison and walks out to a poolside littered with the dead and dying.

        <h1>Gu's Drug Empire</h1>
        <img src="../images/g2.jpg">
        <pre>History</pre>
        <p>
            Soon after Gus moved to Santiago,he met Max Arciniega,a gifted chemist.Gus paid for Max' chemistry education in the University of Santiago.In 1986,Gus and Max moved to Mexico.Gus likely erased all records of his life prior to their arrival at Mexico,possibly because of war crimes he may have committed while serving the Chilean army during the Pinochet regime.By 1989,Gus and Max had started a successful fast food restaurant chain,Los Pollos Hermanos.Using Pollos Hermanos as a front and cover business,they would plan to manufacture and distribute crystal methamphetamine through the Mexican cartel,as the cartel was dependent on Colombia for cocaine and switching to meth would effectively cut the need for Colombian sellers and would be profitable for both sides.To pitch this idea to the cartel,Gus gave samples of the meth to several Cartel foot soldiers,and was eventually granted a meeting with the Cartel's boss,Don Eladio Vuente. Alongside Eladio,two of his most trusted men,Juan Bolsa and Hector Salamanca were present at the meeting.Though Gus and Max tried to convince them with their idea,Eladio saw meth as a "poor man's cocaine".He was also offended by the underhanded way Gus obtained the meeting,and ordered Hector to murder Max.Hector killed Max,and Gus tried to attack Hector.He was brought down and forced to look at the corpse of Max.Eladio told Gus that the only reason he's alive is because he knows who he is.

            By 2008, Gus had arranged a financial partnership with Peter Schuler and Madrigal Electromotive GmbH to finance the meth trade as well as their cover business, fast food restaurant Los Pollos Hermanos. A large superlab was constructed under a laundromat owned by Madrigal where large quantities of crystal meth -- known on the street as Blue Sky -- could be produced on a weekly basis. Gale Boetticher was hired by Gus to design and oversee the construction and Walter White and Jesse Pinkman were later brought in to run the lab.

            In 2009, a vengeful power play by Gus eradicated the cartel and left Gus as the sole producer of meth in the American Southwest. ("Salud")
            
            <br>Downfall and aftermath<br>
            Gus' control over the meth distribution network did not last long as Gus was killed by Hector Salamanca, with the assistance of Walter White ("Face Off"). Many of his henchmen and other people involved were killed in the fallout. The cartel's absence and Gus' death left an empty market for other meth manufacturers to vie for control over.

                    The gang initially met White when he contracted them to arrange the murder of ten of Gus Fring's former employees and associates in three separate jails within a two-minute window. While difficult, the killings go according to plan and all 10 targets are brutally slaughtered. ("Gliding Over All")  

                    Following Walter's abrupt retirement from the business, Todd becomes the primary cook, working with Lydia and Declan. Eventually, Declan fires Todd and the purity of the meth fell dramatically, much to Lydia's chagrin. After she was unable to convince Declan to rehire Todd, Lydia formed an alliance with the gang and orchestrated a hit on Declan and his men. The gang stole the remainder of Declan's methylamine, as well as all of his operation's meth-making equipment, and reinstated Todd as the primary cook ("Buried").

                <p>
                    Following the gang's expansion into meth production, they were hired by Walter White to murder Jesse Pinkman. In exchange for the hit, Walt reluctantly agrees to one more cook to teach Todd how to produce Blue Sky meth himself. ("To'hajiilee")​ After saving Walt from arrest by murdering Hank Schrader and Steven Gomez, Jack and his men steal almost all of Walt's money buried in the desert and take Jesse prisoner to serve as their slave cook, and leave Walt stranded in the desert. ("Ozymandias")

                    Jesse is taken prisoner as a captive in the compound. He is forced to cook meth alongside Todd. During this time, he is tortured and beaten, as seen from his numerous scars. After Jesse nearly escapes the compound, Jack has Andrea killed by Todd. Several members of the gang break into the White Residence and intimidate Skyler, warning her to not disclose the fact that she saw Lydia Rodarte-Quayle at the car wash to any law enforcement authorities ("Granite State").
                    
                    After Walt returns from hiding in his New Hampshire cabin, the signs that he is back in Albuquerque prompts Lydia to hire the gang to kill Walt. Walt visits the compound, claiming to want to show them a new formula, but the gang are always planning to kill him. Before they are able to take him out the entire gang was wiped out when Walt activated an M60 machine gun he placed in the trunk of his car, killing most of the gang. Only Jack and Todd survived, but Todd had his neck broken by Jesse using his handcuffs, and Jack was executed by Walt in the same manner he murdered Hank. Immediately afterwards, Todd's phone receives a call from Lydia, and Walt picks up, revealing to her that he had poisoned her with ricin when they met earlier at The Grove. ("Felina")
                    
                    The deaths of members of the gang are later reported in the news, which Jesse hears on the radio after escaping. ("El Camino")

                        <p>
                            In 2008, Walter White began cooking crystal meth with his former student Jesse Pinkman after Walt found out about his terminal lung cancer diagnosis. His initial plan was to earn enough money to provide for his family after his death, but later became almost completely consumed by his drug empire. In the chaotic birth of the drug empire and it's first days, Walt and Jesse spent several weeks self-distributing before briefly working with Tuco Salamanca.

                            After Tuco's death, Walt and Jesse became self-distributors again, with Jesse temporarily fronting his own drug operation. After the death of Combo, Walt and Jesse began working with Gustavo Fring in his drug empire. The destruction of the Cartel and the collapse of Gus' drug empire led to Walt's drug empire being the only one left.

                            In 2009, after Hector Salamanca killed Gus with Walt's assistance, Walt decided to establish himself as the only major drug kingpin left in the Albuquerque area. He pitched an idea of a three way partnership between himself, Jesse, and Gus' second-in-command at the time, Mike Ehrmantraut. Mike handles all business matters while Walt and Jesse handle the production of their signature Blue Sky. The lawyer Saul Goodman would continue to act as legal counsel. ("Madrigal")

                            Without an RV or superlab to use as a cook site the group had to build a new meth lab. After investigating several options Walt decided for the group to build a mobile lab that would be built inside houses being bug bombed by Vamonos Pest, a cover company the three decided to purchase. They receive three huge stacks of cash—$367,000 each, the gross from their first 50-pound batch, but this steadily dwindles as Mike allocates cuts to the other parts of the operation. The "mules" (drivers) get a flat 20 percent, which elicits Walt’s first objection: “What did Gus pay his mules?” Mike explains that Gus didn’t need mules because he had his own distribution network of Pollos trucks. ("Hazard Pay")

                            Jesse gets back the $120,000 he fronted the group. Ira, the owner of Vamonos Pest, gets $45,000 out of each share. Ira’s crew get $10,000 from each. Saul gets $18,000 from each. Walter is further enraged to learn that a portion of the proceeds from every cook would go to the Gus Fring's nine men in prison as hush money. With a final warning that Walt needs to make peace with these ongoing expenditures (including the methylamine, which would not be free next time), Mike leaves Walt to count his depleted stack of cash, which amounts to $137,000.

                            After coming across issues getting methylamine, the group decided to rob a train of 1,000 gallons of methylamine and replace it with water. With the help of Todd Alquist, the men pulled off the heist but were witnessed by an innocent bystander who was shot and killed by Todd. ("Dead Freight") After the murder, Mike and Jesse decided to retire and sell their share of the methylamine to a rival organization in Arizona run by Declan. ("Buyout")
                            
                            Rather than giving in to Mike and Jesse's plan, Walt decided rather to sell Mike's 34% share in the organization to Declan and would continue to cook his 99.1% pure blue meth, making everyone involved more money in the long run. Jesse, however, decided to leave without a penny because he was tired of the violence and terror. ("Say My Name")

Peter Schuler was hired by Mr. Herzog in 1992 at Madrigal Electromotive GmbH. According to Herzog, Schuler “almost singlehandedly grew our little restaurant division into an industry leader, and a source of great personal pride.” ("Madrigal") However, unbeknownst to anyone Schuler secretly used his position within Madrigal to fund his longtime acquaintance, Gustavo Fring's, vast drug distribution network within the American Southwest through Los Pollos Hermanos and aided him in procuring necessary finances, equipment and chemicals to aid in the production of illicit drugs and the expansion of his empire. At some point the two allowed Lydia Rodarte-Quayle to take part in their secret business and she too aided Fring with his distribution network and the procurement of necessary equipment. By at least, 2004, Schuler provided the financial means for Gustavo to secretly begin the construction of a secret, underground meth lab to domestically produce highly pure methamphetamine to undercut the Cartel's influence in his business and gain a firm grip over the drug trade in the American Southwest.

He had earlier appraised the high grade filter as perfect for a meth lab, but he had not been able to connect Gus to the laundry operation.
                                    
                                    Season 5
                                    Following Peter Schuler's suicide, Mr. Herzog, and other members of the board then flew to Albuquerque to pledge their complete cooperation with the DEA's investigation of Gus Fring's meth distribution network. Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, a Madrigal executive based in the American southwest, was present at this meeting ("Madrigal").
                                    
                                    After Mike's death, Lydia proposed a deal to Walt: sell Blue Sky to the Czech Republic via Madrigal's vast resources. Walt agreed and the deal continued with Jack Welker's Compound after Walt left Albuquerque ("Gliding Over All").
                                    
                                    Following Lydia's poisoning and hospitalization shortly before her death, it can be presumed that Madrigal became the subject of intense public ridicule for its unknown connection to Walter White's drug empire through Lydia and their failure to have identified her as a secret mole in their company in league with Gustavo Fring and Walter White.
