    <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
    <ul>
<li>
    <h1>Season 1</h1>
    
        <p id="pi">Before Breaking Bad became an absolute smash hit for AMC, it was pitched to HBO. Uninterested with the show, HBO rejected it. The channel didn’t see the future potential 
            of Breaking Bad. So, you can bet executives get riled up every time they see it mentioned, which is a lot.</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h1>Season 2</h1>
    <p id="pi">
        In a podcast interview, Vince Gilligan shed some light on some original ideas for the show that never got okayed. That list contained a pitch that included Jesse Pinkman being killed off in season two. Of course, the execs hated it so it never made it into the script.
        </p>
</li>

<li>
    <h1>Season 3</h1>
    <p id="pi">
        For most of Breaking Bad, there was a large distance between Walt’s criminal life and family life. In fact, the two never really collide until the fifth season. By then, viewers had a ton of knowledge on both sides of Walt’s double life.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <h1>Season 4</h1>
    <p id="pi">
        After a drunken night at a local bar with the crew, Cranston decided to get a small tattoo of the Breaking Bad logo on his finger, much to his wife’s disgust. It makes sense though, as this was without a doubt Cranston’s best performance of his career.
    </p>
</li>
     
<li>
    <h1>Season 5</h1>
    <p id="pi">
        While nobody has gone to the level of Bryan Cranston’s character in the show, a couple of struggling educators have actually been arrested for doing things similar to Walter While. 
    </p>

        <pre>Summary</pre>
<p>
    Walter, diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, conspires with Jesse to cook crystal meth to pay for his treatment and provide financial security for his family. Jesse secures an R.V. to cook in, while Walter devises a revolutionary formula using unregulated chemicals, creating a highly pure product tinted blue. After a run-in with the Mexican cartel, Walter adopts the nickname "Heisenberg" and trades his "blue sky" meth with psychotic drug lord Tuco Salamanca. The DEA and Hank, Walt's brother-in-law, become aware of Heisenberg's presence in the drug trade and begin investigating.

<p>
    Tuco and Walter become hostile and Tuco is killed by Hank. After a failed attempt by Walter and Jesse to start their own distribution network leaves one of their dealers arrested and one murdered, Walter hires corrupt lawyer Saul Goodman, who later connects them to high-profile drug distributor Gus Fring and hitman Mike Ehrmantraut. Jesse dates his apartment manager Jane, who introduces him to heroin, making him unreliable. After selling a shipment to Gus, Walt refuses to pay Jesse his half of the money, but Jane blackmails him. Walt returns to Jesse to apologize but instead allows an unconscious Jane to choke on her own vomit. Jesse, traumatized, enters rehab. Walt seems content until he witnesses a mid-air collision of two planes; a result of Jane's father, an air-traffic controller, becoming distraught over her death while working.</p>

<p>
    Skyler learns of Walt's crimes and seeks a divorce from him. Walt briefly retires from the drug trade, but Gus offers him a job cooking meth at a hidden lab with an assistant, Gale. Hank's investigation leads him to Jesse. He finds no evidence, but assaults Jesse and is suspended from the DEA. Walt, in order to keep Jesse from suing Hank, coerces Gus into replacing Gale with Jesse as his lab assistant. Hank is attacked by Tuco's vengeful cousins and kills them, becoming paralyzed in the aftermath. Jesse's behavior becomes erratic, and Walt is forced to kill two of Gus' drug dealers to protect Jesse. After an enraged Gus orders them killed, Walt convinces Jesse to kill Gale so Gus cannot replace them.</p>

<p>
    Hank discovers Walt is Heisenberg and begins gathering evidence. He turns to Jesse, who helps track Walt's money to the reservation. When Walt is arrested, Jack's gang arrives. They kill Hank and Steve, capture Jesse, and take most of Walter's money, leaving him one of seven barrels. Walt uses this to flee to New Hampshire. After months in hiding, Walt plans to surrender but changes course after Elliott and Gretchen publicly minimize his involvement in starting Gray Matter. Walt manipulates Elliott and Gretchen to give his earnings to Walter Jr. once he turns 18. After poisoning Lydia, Walt admits to Skyler that he manufactured meth for his own satisfaction rather than for his family. At Jack's compound, Walter kills Jack and the rest of his gang with a remote turret and frees Jesse, who kills Todd. Wounded by his own weapon, Walt asks Jesse to kill him, but he refuses. The two share a farewell glance before Jesse escapes. Walt dies from his wounds in Jack's meth lab.</p>
