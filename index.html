    <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
    <ul>
<li>
    <h1>Season 1</h1>
    
        <p id="pi">Before Breaking Bad became an absolute smash hit for AMC, it was pitched to HBO. Uninterested with the show, HBO rejected it. The channel didn’t see the future potential 
            of Breaking Bad. So, you can bet executives get riled up every time they see it mentioned, which is a lot.</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h1>Season 2</h1>
    <p id="pi">
        In a podcast interview, Vince Gilligan shed some light on some original ideas for the show that never got okayed. That list contained a pitch that included Jesse Pinkman being killed off in season two. Of course, the execs hated it so it never made it into the script.
        </p>
</li>

<li>
    <h1>Season 3</h1>
    <p id="pi">
        For most of Breaking Bad, there was a large distance between Walt’s criminal life and family life. In fact, the two never really collide until the fifth season. By then, viewers had a ton of knowledge on both sides of Walt’s double life.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <h1>Season 4</h1>
    <p id="pi">
        After a drunken night at a local bar with the crew, Cranston decided to get a small tattoo of the Breaking Bad logo on his finger, much to his wife’s disgust. It makes sense though, as this was without a doubt Cranston’s best performance of his career.
    </p>
</li>
     
<li>
    <h1>Season 5</h1>
    <p id="pi">
        While nobody has gone to the level of Bryan Cranston’s character in the show, a couple of struggling educators have actually been arrested for doing things similar to Walter While.

    <pre>Summary</pre>
<p id="metxt">
    Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid, overqualified, and dispirited high-school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. White turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce and distribute crystal meth to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. The show aired on AMC from January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for a total of 62 episodes.

<pre>Setting</pre>
<p>
    Set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, between 2008 and 2010,[11] Breaking Bad follows Walter White, a modest high school chemistry teacher who transforms into a ruthless kingpin in the local methamphetamine drug trade, driven to financially provide for his family after being diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. Initially making only small batches of meth with his former student Jesse Pinkman in a rolling meth lab, Walter and Jesse eventually expand to make larger batches of special blue meth that is incredibly pure and creates high demand. Walter takes on the name "Heisenberg" to mask his identity. Because of his drug-related activities, Walter eventually finds himself at odds with his family, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) through his brother-in-law Hank Schrader, the local gangs, and the Mexican drug cartels (including their regional distributors), putting him and his family's lives at risk.

<pre>Development History</pre>
<p>
    The network ordered nine episodes for the first season (including the pilot), but the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike limited the production to seven episodes, as well as delaying the start of production for the second season.[32] Within the original nine-episode arc, Gilligan had planned to kill off Jesse or Hank, as a "ballsy" moment to end the season on.[26] This death was eliminated with the limited episode count, which Gilligan found to be a net positive given the strength of acting that both Paul and Norris brought to these roles through the seasons.[26] The strike also helped to slow down production long enough for Gilligan and his writing team to readjust the pacing of the show, which in the original arc had been moving too quickly.[26] Gould stated that the writer's strike "saved the show", as if they had produced the two additional episodes in the first season, they would have gone down a different creative path that he believes would have led to the show's cancellation by its third season.[33]

The initial versions of the script were set in Riverside, California, but at the suggestion of Sony, Albuquerque was chosen for the production's location due to the favorable financial conditions offered by the state of New Mexico. Once Gilligan recognized that this would mean "we'd always have to be avoiding the Sandia Mountains" in shots directed toward the east, the story setting was changed to the actual production location.[34][35] It was shot primarily on 35 mm film,[36] with digital cameras employed as needed for additional angles, point of view shots and time-lapse photography.[37] Breaking Bad cost $3 million per episode to produce, higher than the average cost for a basic cable program.[7]

Around 2010, AMC had expressed to Sony Pictures Television and Gilligan that they felt that the third season would be the last for Breaking Bad. Sony started to shop the show around, having gained quick interest from the FX network for two more seasons, upon which AMC changed its mind and allowed the show to continue.[38] At the same time, Netflix was starting to aggressively shop for content to add to its service and arranged a deal with Sony for Breaking Bad to be available after the airing of the fourth season. Knowing that AMC had placed Breaking Bad on a potential cancellation route, Sony pushed to have the show added to the service in time for the fourth season. Breaking Bad's viewership grew greatly as viewers binged the series on Netflix, helping to assure that a fifth season could be made. The fifth-season premiere had more than double the viewership compared to the fourth season premiere, attributed to the Netflix availability.[38] Gilligan thanked Netflix at the Emmy Awards in September 2013 after the series' conclusion for the popularity of the series, saying that Netflix "kept us on the air.

    <h1><u><i>Highlight Episodes..</i></u></h1>
<div class="bo">
    <h1>‘Half Measures’ – Season 3, Episode 12</h1>
    <img src="images/high3.jpg">
    <p>It’s monologues like this one that have made Mike Ehrmantraut (and by extension actor Jonathan Banks) such a firm fan favourite. Banks modestly calls shooting this scene “a good day of work”, preferring to highlight the Jesse and Mike drop-off montage – “I don't think for all that time that we ever stopped laughing” – but there’s no doubt that this, pipping even his death or his unfortunate farewell to his granddaughter, is The Fixer’s finest hour. Watch it in full here, and try not to blub too loudly.

        The irony of it is, of course, that a story that comes from a place of compassion for the weak leads to great violence. Mike means to encourage Walt to cut Jesse loose, to convince him that his partner is a danger, but instead Walt is motivated to run over two drug-dealers, and finish the job with a bullet to the head of one, in order to keep Jesse safe.</p>
</div>
<div class="bo">
    <h1>‘Gliding Over All’ – Season 5A, Episode 8</h1>
    <img src="images/high1.jpg">
    <p>Jesse searching for the Ricin cigarette (‘Stay On The Outside’ – Whitey), noopener noreferrer}), Hank’s clue collecting (‘Word Mule’ – Jim White that comes at the very end of Season 5A. This is your last chance to see the going when the going was good. The Empire Business is international now, Todd is proving an adequate Jesse replacement, Skylar is happy to launder all those mad stacks and the fumigation tent trick is working like a charm. It’s a glorious time to be making meth, and there was no better song to accompany it. That’s even though the title doesn't actually have anything to do with drugs: its writers, Tommy James And The Shondells, insist the words just “jumped out” from a part of the Old Testament.

        A secondary shout-out has to go to The Simpsons for their mickey take of this very montage, as well as to The Heisenberg Song from the Season 2 episode, ‘Negro And Azul’, which somehow also ended up in Grand Theft Auto V.</p>
</div>
<div class="bo">
    <h1>‘Cornered’ – Season 4, Episode 6</h1>
    <img src="images/high2.jpg">
    <p>
        The best of the show’s immortal catchphrases, “I am the one who knocks”, takes precedence even over Heisenberg’s “Say my name” a season later. To put it into context, look at the real thing here (Goddamn right) and then Samuel L. Jackson’s take (Goddamn wrong) and imagine you’re an Emmy award judge trying to work out whether you should give Cranston his fourth little-golden-angel-holding-a-nucleus. A pretty easy decision, you’d think – you’re too scared not to give it to him. Instead, Damian Lewis wins it for Homeland, and the internet is suddenly in uproar. At least he won in it this year, right? Oh. As you were.

In any case, no other single moment better shows Heisenberg’s snarling rage, pride and malice than this hissed outburst, leaving Skyler White understandably horrified by the man she married.
